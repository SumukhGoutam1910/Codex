## 🎯 MAIN DEMO: Real-World Emergency Workflow

### **🎮 Step 1: Admin Control Panel Experience**
1. **Login as Admin** → Navigate to **Control Panel** (`/admin`)
2. **System Overview**: View live statistics
   - Active cameras monitoring the network
   - Available responder units
   - Recent AI detections

### **🔥 Step 2: Simulate AI Fire Detection**
1. In the **"AI Detection Simulation"** section
2. Choose any **online camera** (e.g., "Kitchen, Ground Floor")
3. Click **"Simulate Detection"** 
4. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - AI processes camera feed (realistic processing time)
   - Creates incident with confidence score (85-100% for fire)
   - Includes bounding boxes and metadata
   - **New incident appears in "Pending Review"**

### **🚒 Step 3: Emergency Response Dispatch**
1. **New incident shows in "Pending Review"** panel
2. Click **"Dispatch Unit"** on the incident
3. **System automatically**:
   - Selects nearest available responder unit
   - Updates incident status to "Dispatched" 
   - Changes responder status to "Responding"
   - **Incident moves to "Dispatched" panel**

### **🎯 Step 4: Field Response Simulation**
1. **Incident now in "Dispatched"** panel shows unit en route
2. Click **"Mark Engaged"** when unit arrives on scene
3. **System updates**:
   - Incident status becomes "Engaged"
   - Responder marked as "On Scene"
   - **Incident moves to "On Scene" panel**

### **✅ Step 5: Incident Resolution**
1. **Incident in "On Scene"** panel shows active response
2. Click **"Mark Resolved"** when emergency is handled
3. **Complete cycle**:
   - Incident closed as "Resolved"
   - Responder returns to "Available" status
   - **Full workflow complete!**
